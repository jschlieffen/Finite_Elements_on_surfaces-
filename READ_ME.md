Finite Elements method on surfaces
================================

This program implements the Finite Element Method (FEM) on surfaces. It follows the example outlined by Elliot and Dzuik in their paper, "Finite Element Method for the Beltrami Operator on Arbitrary Surfaces."

Getting started
---------------

To run the Program one needs to execute the Program `exec.py`. The following libarys must be installed
* numpy
* sympy
* plotly
* (eventually pandas)

The program generates plots, which are saved in the "plots" folder. Currently, there are several plots from our initial test runs.
